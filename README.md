# express-angular1.4-experiment

A experiment project of express 4X and angular 1.4

This project is based on the starter project of [express-angular-starter](https://github.com/xie-qianyue/express-angular-starter).

## Todos
Finally 1.4 doesn't include the new router, so the router part won't change.
As the [Migration Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/migration#migrating-from-1-3-to-1-4) shows, there are not so much updates which I can implement in this project. Maybe a 2.0 playground would be more interesting.

## Issues
Today it has a problem because of the bug [#193](https://github.com/angular/router/issues/193) of the new angular router.
